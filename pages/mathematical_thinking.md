## Areas of Mathematics
### [[Formal logic]]
## Logical Combinators
### AND
#### Denoted by ^ (often called a wedge)
### OR
#### Denoted by v (called a disjunctive)
#### Two types of OR
##### Exclusive-or
###### a = 0 v b = 0
##### Inclusive-or
###### The form that is used in mathematics
###### ab = 0 if a =0 v b = 0
### NOT
#### Denoted by ¬ (old style is a tilde ~)
### Propositional Truth Tables
#### Lists states for the conjuncts or disjuncts and whether they are true or false in isolation, and then whether the total is true or false
## Theorems
### [[Prime Number Theorem]]
## Paradoxes
### The [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]
## Mathematical Language
### Mathematical statements are either:
#### Object _a_ has property _P_
#### Every object of type _T_ has property _P_
#### There is an object of type _T_ having property _P_
#### If _Statement A_ then _Statement B_
## Misc Notes
### Nice quote about [[New Ways of Thinking]]
### Euclid's book 'Elements'
